### Extracting Seasonality (gamma) Component of Triple Exponential MA ###

#breaks timeseries raw data into trend, seasonality, and random noise

#fitted prediction gets better and better over the years and the variance corrects itself

### created many visuals and understood seasonality element of Holts-Winter Exponential Smoothing ###
### could predict in the short term using exponential smoothing and used CUSUM equation and 
seasonality values in Excel to find change detection of summer ending in Atlanta using 
temperature data ###
